# Data-Cleaning-1
Data-Cleaning-1  --> As the name of the project indicates one of the most quintessential process and perhaps the most time consuming process in Data Science Project life cycle. This project showcases transformation of unstructured data to structured and semi-structured formats. The unstructured data is converted into json and xml, which is the industry standard of data representations for various web and data science applications. This project also exhibits the ability to leverage "Pandas" and several other libraries for python to perform textual transformations.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The project has one main file which process the raw unstructred data into JSON and XML.

*TextProcessor.ipynb* --> This python notebook combines the python executable code to perform text transformation and provides the logic or rather the reasoning for all operations and/or the analysis from the previous step in form of Markdown. This file contains all the executable code to convert a text file which contains tons of data into structured json data. The so converted json object is then written to a file under the name *Text2Json.json* and subsequently the converted XML is written to *Text2XML.xml* file.
